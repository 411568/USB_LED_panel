<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Small, USB powered LED lamp with up to 6 1W power LEDs. It uses diodes without a radiator, soldered directly onto the PCB. 
The power is delivered by the AP63203 step-down converter with up to 2A output current. The LEDs have forward voltage of about 3.1-3.2V at currents around 200mA, 
that is why I decided to use a simple and cheap 3.3V converter with 1Ohm resistors splitting the power to every LED connected in parallel. 
This way I could also not solder in all of the LEDs, in the end I went with only 3 of them, as I thought it was enough for my usage.
